        <h2>HABITS</h2>
        <p>Everyday our lives are governed by habit. These habits are the little routines and small ways of doing things. Most people are unaware or are only slightly aware that theyâ€™re doing them.
            This application allows the user to track: different habits, write and delete them, as well as determine their repetition. Also, one of the most interesting features of the app is: users can track their expenses.

            <i> New features are expected soon !!</i> 	&#128578;
